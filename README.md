# Failurous Java client

This is the Java client for the [Failurous](http://github.com/mnylen/failurous) exception tracking application.

## Installation

Note: If you're using Guice, Spring, and/or GWT, also see the Integrations section below.

### 1. Configure pom.xml

To integrate Failurous to a Java webapp, first add the Sonatype Nexus repository to your POM and/or Maven settings:

    <repository>
      <id>sonatype-nexus</id>
      <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public</url>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </releases>
    </repository>
		
Next, add a dependency to the Failurous Java client:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.failurous</groupId>
      <artifactId>failurous-java</artifactId>
      <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
		
### 2. Configure Failurous

Add a file called `failurous.properties` to the root of your classpath (in Maven projects this is usually `src/main/resources`),
and set its contents to:

    failurous.server.address = <YOUR-FAILUROUS-INSTALLATION>
    failurous.api.key = <API-FAILUROUS-PROJECT-API-KEY>
    
## Reporting exceptions occurring in web requests
    
Configure the Failurous Java client to intercept exceptions by adding it as a servlet filter to your web.xml:

	<filter>
		<filter-name>failurous</filter-name>
		<filter-class>com.failurous.FailurousServletFilter</filter-class>
	</filter>
	
	<filter-mapping>
		<filter-name>failurous</filter-name>
		<url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
	</filter-mapping>
		
The filter will catch any exceptions your app threw and deliver them to the Failurous service for later viewing.

Notice that the position of the filter-mapping element affects which exceptions Failurous will report. Any filter mappings appearing before the failurous filter mapping in web.xml will not be reported, since they are executed outside its scope.

## Reporting exceptions occurring elsewhere

To send exceptions occurring outside the request/response cycle, `FailSender` can be invoked directly.
The `ExceptionFail` convenience class can be used to include the usual exception information (stack trace, etc.)
in the report without having to configure anything:

    try {
      myFailingMethod();
    } catch (MyException e) {
      FailSenderFactory.getSender().send(new ExceptionFail(e));
      throw e;
    }
       
## Sending custom notifications

failurous-java can be used to send custom notifications to Failurous. This can be accomplished by building an instance of `Fail` and sending it with the `FailSender` API:

    FailSender sender = FailSenderFactory.getSender();
    sender.send(new Fail("50 invalid login attempts by "+loginName, "LoginService.login()"));

More information can be included by adding sections and fields:

    Fail myFail = new Fail("50 invalid login attempts", "LoginService.login()");
    
    FailSection summary = myFail.addSection("summary");
    summary.addField("user", loginName);
    
    FailSenderFactory.getSender().send(myFail);
